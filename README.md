## What's this?
`to/go links` is a Chrome extension, that allows you to use slick shortcuts to go to web-resources.  
As an example you can make `to/fe` shortcut to go to the frontend github repo.  
As person, who loves shorcuts, I found it quite useful to have something that lets me go to the complex/favourite/rare addresses using short and simple alias.
When you use it once, it's kinda difficult to get off from it. I swear.

## Live
This one is published in Chrome dev store, so you can use it already via [link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/togo-links/flpconpanaaillfingfdpenpahkeegfg?hl=ru&authuser=0).

## Support
Currenty it's only available in Chrome (and any other Chromium-based browsers, e.g. Arc, Opera, Edge).  
The extension uses Manifest V3, so unfortunately there is no fast way to port it on Firefox.

## What else can you do
So the default command to run your quick links is `to/`. If it looks boring you can change it anytime.  
I personally use `r/`.
